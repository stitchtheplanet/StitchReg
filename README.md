# Stitch Regulator for Juki TL Machines

This is a stitch regulator that can be used with Juki TL machines. Commercial versions of these are very expensive ($700 - $1,000 USD), but the way they work is fairly simple. You can build a DIY version using an Arduino microcontroller, an old PS/2 optical mouse, and a handful of inexpensive electronic components.
