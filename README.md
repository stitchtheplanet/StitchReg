# Stitch Regulator for Juki TL Machines

This is a stitch regulator that can be used with Juki TL machines. Commercial versions of these are very expensive ($700 - $1,000 USD), but the way they work is fairly simple. You can build a DIY version using an Arduino microcontroller, an old PS/2 optical mouse, and a handful of inexpensive electronic components.

## Questions

### Q: What is a stitch regulator?
A: A stitch regulator senses movement of the machine or fabric and adjusts the speed of the needle to maintain a consistent stitch length.

### Q: What machines does this work on?
A: Any Juki TL machine should work. Specifically, any machine that uses the Juki JC-001 pedal.

### Q: Can it work with other machines?
A: Maybe? If the foot pedal acts as a variable resistor this could potentially be adapted. You might have to change the R2 and R3 resistors and possibly use a different version of the 4131 chip.

### Q: Does this work with or without a quilting frame?
A: It can work with both, depending how you mount the sensor!

### Q: Do I need to know electronics or coding to use this?
A: It would help, but no. At least I hope not, if I write the instructions well enough!

### Q: Will you build and sell me one of these?
A: Not at this point, it's still under development and subject to change a lot.
